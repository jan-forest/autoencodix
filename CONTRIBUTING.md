## Feature Request

Have a great idea for a new feature in Autoencodix? Let us know by submitting a feature request!
We are in particular interested in expanding the number of architectures and related options. Hence, we value your input what might be missing in order to enable your application and research on autoencoders with our framework.

If you'd like to take the initiative, feel free to [fork Autoencodix](https://github.com/jan-forest/autoencodix/fork), work on implementing the feature, and submit a patch. Before starting, it is best to [open an issue](https://github.com/jan-forest/autoencodix/issues/new/choose) first to describe your enhancement. This helps you to get an early feedback and ensures that your work can be effectively incorporated into the Autoencodix codebase, saving time and aligning with the project’s direction.

## Bug Report
Even the smartest Gaul can make mistakes, so if you encounter a bug when using Autoencodix, we highly appreciate a bug report. 
When submitting a [bug report](https://github.com/jan-forest/autoencodix/issues/new/choose), please provide as much context as possible. In particular, always attach the related YAML-config causing the issue. Further, depending on the issue try to include details like the Python version, Autoencodix version, any error messages or stack traces, and clear steps to reproduce the issue (if possible, include a small sample dataset that triggers the error). The more information provided, the easier it will be to address the issue effectively
